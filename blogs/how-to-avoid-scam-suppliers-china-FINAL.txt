How to Avoid Scam Suppliers When Sourcing from China

I'm going to be direct with you: yes, there are scam suppliers in China. But the good news? They're easier to spot than you think.

I'm Stephen, Head of Brand & Strategy at Fominte. Part of my job is reviewing the inquiries that come through our system, and I see a pattern. Many buyers ask the wrong questions. They ask about price and MOQ. What they should be asking is: "How do I know you're real?"

Eric, our Head of Sales, has been in this industry long enough to have seen both sides. Buyers who got burned, buyers who built successful partnerships. The difference isn't luck.

This guide will give you 7 red flags that signal a potential scam, 3 verification methods you can use today, and 2 real case studies showing what success and failure look like.

7 RED FLAGS TO WATCH OUT FOR

Red Flag #1: No Physical Factory Address or Video Tour Available

If a supplier can't or won't show you where they actually make things, that's your first warning.

What this looks like:
- They only provide an email address or WeChat contact
- They refuse video factory tour requests (post-pandemic, this excuse doesn't hold)
- The address they give you doesn't show up on Google Maps, or it's clearly an office building or residential area

Trading companies aren't inherently bad. Some are excellent partners who coordinate multiple factories and add real value. But if someone claims to be a factory and won't show you a factory, that's a problem.

At Fominte, we provide our factory address and business license upfront. We're happy to schedule a video tour if you give us advance notice. It's not about being perfect. It's about being transparent.

Red Flag #2: Prices Significantly Lower Than Market Average

You've probably heard the saying: "If it's too good to be true, it probably is." In sourcing, this is rarely wrong.

What this looks like:
- Their quote is 30-50% lower than everyone else
- They claim "direct factory pricing" but can't explain their cost structure
- They dodge questions about materials or processes

Shawn, our founder, has a line I use often: "Price is information. But it's not the only information. If someone's price is significantly lower, there's a reason. Find out what it is."

Common traps:
1. They use the low price to hook you, take your deposit, and disappear
2. They substitute cheaper materials after you've committed
3. They're actually a middleman adding margin on top of margin, and something has to give — usually quality

Eric told me about a case last month. A US buyer came to us for a second quote. The first quote they got was 60% of ours. I asked them: "How much deposit did that supplier ask for?" They said 50%. Eric's response was: "That's your answer right there."

Red Flag #3: Requesting Large Upfront Payments (50%+ Deposit)

Let's talk about what's normal.

Industry standard:
- Legitimate factories typically request 30% deposit
- Custom or specialized products might require 40%, but rarely more
- Balance is paid before shipment

Why 50%+ is a red flag: A factory with a real operation has working capital. They don't need you to fund their entire production run upfront. Scammers do, because they're using your money to "operate" (or more likely, to disappear).

Safer approach:
- Stick to 30% deposit + 70% before shipping
- Use payment protection like Trade Assurance or Letters of Credit for larger orders
- Never pay 100% upfront unless you've already worked together successfully

---

Red Flag #4: No Samples Policy or "Free Samples" Trap

There are two extremes here, and both are dangerous.

Extreme #1: No samples at all
- "We don't do samples, just place the order"
- This often means they have no production capability and will outsource (or vanish)

Extreme #2: "Free samples" with exorbitant shipping
- "Samples are free, but shipping is $200"
- This is a disguised scam. They're making money on the shipping markup.

What's reasonable: At Fominte, we charge cost price for samples. We're not making money on them, but we're also not giving away our work for free. If you place a bulk order, we'll credit the sample cost. Shipping is charged at actual rates, and we provide tracking.

If a supplier's sample policy doesn't make basic business sense, trust your instinct.

---

Red Flag #5: Poor Communication or Copy-Paste Responses

Communication quality tells you a lot about how a supplier operates.

What this looks like:
- Replies are templated and don't address your specific questions
- They never ask about your product's use case, target market, or technical requirements
- They only respond to questions about price and MOQ, nothing else

Shawn has another line I reference constantly: "A good supplier doesn't just take your order. They ask questions that save you from mistakes you don't even know you're about to make."

Questions a good supplier asks:
- What's this product for?
- What quality standards does your target market expect?
- Does your team have experience with this type of production?
- Is your delivery timeline flexible, or is it locked?

When Eric talks to new buyers, he's not just answering questions. He's asking them. That's how you build something that actually works.

---

Red Flag #6: No Business License or Certification

This should be non-negotiable.

Minimum verification requirements:
- Business License (营业执照)
- Export License
- If they claim ISO, BSCI, or other certifications, ask for the certificate number and verify it

How to verify:
- China's National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System lets you look up business licenses
- ISO certificates can be verified on the ISO website
- BSCI and other audits have verification portals

Common traps:
- Photoshopped certificates (ask for high-resolution versions and verify the numbers)
- "We're applying for it" but they've been "applying" for two years

If a supplier resists providing basic documentation, they're either hiding something or they're not legitimate. Either way, walk away.

---

Red Flag #7: Pressure Tactics or "Limited Time Offers"

Urgency is a classic manipulation tactic.

What this looks like:
- "This price is only valid today"
- "We're almost sold out, order now or lose your spot"
- "Other customers are asking about this, pay the deposit to secure it"

Factories have production schedules. Real suppliers don't operate like flash sale websites. Pressure tactics are sales strategies, not supply chain realities.

We don't do pressure sales at Fominte. If you need time to think, take time. Good partnerships aren't built on urgency. They're built on trust.

If someone is rushing you before you've had a chance to verify anything, that's a sign they don't want you to verify anything.

3 VERIFICATION METHODS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

Knowing the red flags is step one. Step two is actively verifying before you commit.

Method #1: Request a Live Video Factory Tour

What to ask for:
- A live video call, not a pre-recorded video
- A tour of key areas: production floor, quality control area, raw material storage
- Ask them to show an order that's currently in production

Red flags during the call:
- They refuse the video tour entirely
- They'll only send photos or pre-recorded footage
- The video is blurry, or they only show the office and avoid the production floor

Post-pandemic, video calls are standard business practice. If a factory won't show you their operation, assume they don't have one.

---

Method #2: Request References from Past Clients

This is simple but surprisingly effective.

How to do it:
- Ask for 2-3 recent client references, ideally in your target market
- Contact them directly (not through the supplier)

Questions to ask the references:
- Were deliveries on time?
- Was quality consistent?
- When issues came up, was communication smooth?
- Would you work with them again?

Eric's take: "We're happy to provide client references if the client agrees to it. If a factory refuses to provide any references at all, you should ask yourself why."

---

Method #3: Start with a Small Test Order

This is the safest verification method, but it requires patience.

How it works:
- Don't go big on the first order
- Even if their MOQ is 500 units, try to negotiate a smaller test batch
- Use this order to evaluate quality, delivery time, and communication

What you're testing:
- Does the product match the sample?
- Do they deliver on time?
- Is communication efficient and honest?
- How do they handle problems when they arise?

Shawn's principle: "We'd rather have a small first order that builds trust than a big order that creates problems."

At Fominte, we're willing to negotiate lower MOQs for first-time clients. The goal isn't to maximize the first transaction. It's to build a relationship that lasts.

CASE STUDY: TWO BUYERS, TWO OUTCOMES

Let me show you what this looks like in practice.

Buyer A: The Cautious One

Background: A small US-based brand, first time sourcing lace fabric from China.

What they did right:
1. Requested a video factory tour
2. Ordered samples of 3 different fabrics (1 yard each)
3. Actually tested the samples — cut them, sewed them, washed them
4. Asked for client references and contacted them for verification
5. Placed a first order at the minimum MOQ

Result: The samples held up to testing. Communication was clear and proactive. The factory (it was us, actually) asked questions about their sewing equipment and target market to make sure the fabric would work for their use case. First order delivered on time. They're now a long-term partner.

My take: She asked all the right questions. She wasn't looking for the cheapest option. She was looking for the most reliable one. That's the mindset that wins.

---

Buyer B: The Rushed One

Background: A European retailer rushing to meet a seasonal deadline.

What went wrong:
1. Only looked at price, chose the lowest quote
2. Didn't request samples ("too expensive, we trust them")
3. Paid a 50% deposit
4. The "factory" only sent photos of an office, never showed the production floor

Result: Two weeks after payment, they couldn't reach the supplier. Email bounced. WeChat account deleted. They lost €8,000.

Eric's observation: We actually received an inquiry from this buyer a few months later. They said: "I learned my lesson. I'm willing to pay a fair price now, if you can give me confidence." We work with them now, and the relationship is solid. But it cost them €8,000 to learn what they could have avoided.

HOW FOMINTE BUILDS TRUST

I want to be transparent about how we approach this, because it's part of the answer to "how do you know who's real?"

1. We Choose Transparency

This industry loves to keep things mysterious. We don't. You ask about our process, we explain it. You ask about cost structure, we break it down. That's how trust is built.

2. We Provide Verification Proactively

- Business license and export permits available on request
- Video factory tours (with advance scheduling)
- Client references (with client permission)

We're not perfect, but we're real. And we can prove it.

3. We Use Fair Commercial Terms

- 30% deposit is standard
- Samples are charged at cost (credited toward bulk orders)
- Delivery commitments go in the contract, not just the email

4. We Think Long-Term

We don't do one-time orders. Our sweet spot is the buyer who thinks three seasons ahead, not three weeks. If you're looking for a quick transaction, there are cheaper options. If you're looking for a partner who'll still be here in five years, let's talk.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Scam suppliers exist. But they follow patterns. If you know the 7 red flags and use the 3 verification methods, you're already ahead of most buyers.

What I'd do if I were you:

1. Print out the 7 red flags and check them against every supplier you're considering
2. Don't skip verification steps, even if you're in a rush (especially if you're in a rush)
3. Start small and build trust before committing to large orders

The goal isn't to avoid China as a sourcing destination. The goal is to find the real factories among the noise.
