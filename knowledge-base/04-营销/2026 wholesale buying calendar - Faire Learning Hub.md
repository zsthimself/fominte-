In wholesale, timing is leverage. Independent retailers who plan ahead are buying before demand concentrates—which is also when competition is lower, selection is broader, and decisions feel less reactive.

Using global Faire search data from 2025, this 2026 wholesale buying calendar shows how retailer demand builds month by month, across major holidays and seasonal moments. Rather than focusing only on peak months, this guide highlights early signals, acceleration points, and compressed buying windows, so you can plan with confidence instead of urgency.

### How to read this wholesale buying calendar

This calendar is informed by aggregated global search activity on Faire, which reflects when retailers are actively planning and sourcing inventory.

-   Start month shows when demand begins to rise meaningfully
-   Acceleration period highlights the months when search activity increases most rapidly; this is when core wholesale orders are typically placed
-   Peak month indicates when buying activity is highest

Use the start month to anchor initial assortment planning, the acceleration period to place core orders, and the peak month to guide reorders rather than first buys. The goal is not to buy everything early, but to shift your first commitments earlier in the curve, when selection is broader and competition is lower. 

**Key takeaways for 2026 buying**

-   Most wholesale demand starts earlier than the selling moment, often by several months
-   The steepest competition occurs after acceleration begins, not at the peak
-   Overlapping seasons (spring/Easter, fall/Halloween) benefit from bundled planning
-   Markets differ meaningfully in peak timing, making local calendars essential

### Global wholesale buying trends: What the data shows for 2026

Across markets, one pattern is clear: Retailer demand starts earlier than most selling moments and accelerates faster than many retailers expect.

Here’s how it plays out across the year. 

#### Valentine’s Day: Early signals, sharp January spike

-   Start: October
-   Acceleration period: November–January
-   Peak: January
-   Estimated annual search volume: 88,000

Globally, Valentine’s Day demand begins quietly in the fall, then accelerates dramatically during the holidays. In 2024, global Valentine’s searches grew from 3,614 in November to 25,567 in December, a 7x increase in one month. Demand rose again in January 2025, reaching a peak of 48,411 searches.

More than 85% of all Valentine’s demand occurred between December and February, creating a short, competitive buying window concentrated immediately after the holidays.

What this means for you: Retailers who place initial Valentine’s orders before year-end are buying ahead of the steepest demand curve, when inventory is less competitive and lead times are more forgiving.

#### Easter and spring: Overlapping buying demand, shared planning window

-   Easter start: December | Acceleration period: January–March | Peak: March | Volume: 72,000
-   Spring start: November | Acceleration period: December–February | Peak: February | Volume: 61,000

Easter and spring buying overlap heavily, both in timing and intent. Globally, Easter searches climbed from 953 in November to over 13,000 by January, then peaked in March at over 23,000 searches. Spring followed a similar curve, building steadily through winter and peaking earlier, in February.

Together, these seasons create a concentrated planning period between December and February, when retailers are refreshing decor, gifting, and transitioning assortments at the same time.

What this means for you: Bundling spring and Easter buying into a single early-year planning cycle can reduce fragmented orders and create a smoother inventory transition into Q2.

#### Mother’s Day: One of the longest planning curves

-   Start: January
-   Acceleration period: February–April
-   Peak: April
-   Estimated global search volume: 43,000

Mother’s Day demand builds gradually rather than spiking suddenly. Global searches grew from 608 in December to 2,848 in January, then continued climbing through early spring, peaking in April at 21,481 searches.

This extended ramp-up gives retailers more time to plan, but also rewards those who act early, before demand consolidates.

What this means for you: Early assortment building paired with targeted spring reorders helps retailers stay ahead of April demand without overcommitting too soon.

#### Summer: Gradual build, extended reorders

-   Start: January
-   Acceleration: February–May
-   Peak: May
-   Estimated global search volume: 84,000

Summer demand begins earlier than many retailers expect and builds gradually through late winter and spring. Globally, searches increased by about 40% from January to February, then continued rising month over month, more than doubling overall between January and March before peaking in May at 14,924 searches. Unlike sharper holiday spikes, summer demand remains active through June and July as retailers continue reordering in-season.

What this means for you: Summer rewards early core planning followed by flexible reorders, rather than last-minute buying. Retailers who begin sourcing in late winter can respond quickly as demand builds through spring.

#### Fall and Halloween: Fast acceleration in late summer

-   Fall start: May | Acceleration: June–August | Peak: August | Volume: 130,000
-   Halloween start: May | Acceleration: July–September | Peak: September | Volume: 88,000

Fall demand begins building in early summer, especially for home and transitional categories. Halloween demand builds all summer, then intensifies quickly heading into peak season: Global searches jump from 4,462 in June to 14,684 in July (more than 3x), before rising again through August and peaking in September at 26,114.

What this means: Late summer is a critical inflection point. Retailers who wait until September are buying at peak competition.

#### Christmas and holiday: The earliest and biggest buying moments

-   Start: May
-   Acceleration: August–November
-   Peak: November
-   Estimated global search volume: 294,000

The holiday season drives more demand than any other moment on the calendar, and it consistently starts earlier than many retailers expect. In 2025, global holiday searches grew from 4,676 in May to 27,931 by August, then more than doubled again by October, reaching 74,369 searches.

Demand peaked in November at 82,624 searches, with over 55% of total annual holiday demand concentrated in October and November alone.

What this means for you: The most strategic holiday buying happens _before_ peak season. Retailers who place orders in late summer or early fall avoid the most competitive window while still staying close enough to the season to respond to trends.

### How these trends shift by market

While global demand follows a consistent seasonal rhythm, the timing and intensity of buying activity vary meaningfully by market. Understanding these differences helps you plan earlier and more precisely for your region.

#### United Kingdom: Earlier peaks, higher competition

Christmas demand in the UK starts earlier and reaches a larger overall scale than in other European markets.

-   Christmas volume: 24,000
-   Starts: June
-   Peak: October

UK holiday searches begin building in early summer and intensify quickly heading into fall. Demand is already elevated by September and peaks in October, making September and October the most competitive wholesale buying months of the year.

#### France: Later peaks, longer tail

French demand builds more gradually and peaks later.

-   Noël (Christmas) volume: 5,000
-   Start: June
-   Peak: November

Rather than spiking sharply in early fall, French searches continue building through October and peak in November. This extended curve offers retailers slightly more flexibility, but still rewards those who finalize holiday assortments before November, when demand is at its highest.

#### Germany: Smaller market, tighter windows

Germany shows more concentrated demand patterns, with shorter planning windows and earlier peaks.

-   Weihnachten (Christmas) volume: 5,000
-   Start: May
-   Peak: September

Holiday demand in Germany builds earlier in the year and peaks by September, earlier than in neighboring markets. Retailers tend to plan decisively, placing orders well ahead of peak season rather than spreading buying across the fall.

#### Canada: U.S.-like seasonality, earlier commitment

Canadian wholesale demand is driven by clearly defined holiday peaks, with buying activity concentrated into short windows rather than building gradually across the year.

-   Valentine’s Day: Estimated search volume of 2,500, starting in November and peaking in January
-   Summer: Estimated search volume of 2,500, starting in December and peaking in June
-   Halloween: Estimated search volume of 500, starting in June and peaking in September
-   Christmas: Estimated search volume of 10,000, starting in June and peaking in October

Across major holidays, Canadian demand tends to concentrate into one or two peak months, making early planning important, particularly for holiday inventory, where demand peaks before November.

#### **Methodology note**

This calendar is based on aggregated global search activity on Faire from late 2024 through 2025 and is used to model retailer planning behavior for the 2026 buying cycle.

Search activity reflects when retailers are actively researching and sourcing inventory, not consumer demand or sales volume. Figures are directional and intended to highlight timing, acceleration, and concentration of buying activity rather than exact order quantities.
